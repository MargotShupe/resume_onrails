                    A results-oriented professional originally from Mexico with a successful background in sales and international corporate experience. As a rebranding analyst for AT&T, I developed my analytical and project management skills, while my experience in the hospitality industry as an account manager allowed me to showcase my strategic thinking and relationship-building abilities. Working for the banking industry as a banker, I further honed my financial acumen and problem-solving capabilities. Currently, as a customer service advocate at GPI, I leverage my communication and interpersonal skills to provide exceptional support to clients. A self-motived individual who enjoys challenges, I thrive in fast-paced environments and am always eager to learn and grow.
